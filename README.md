Redoing old league of legends helper site

Old project that I started in my sophomore year. Didn't backup my repository so it was destroyed when I lost access to my cs server space. Redoing the project from scratch as a fun refresher. 

The goal is to create a site that functions like a more indepth version of lolcounter helping players who use this site get an upperhand in their league of legends matches by knowing what champions are weak against and what they work well with.
